# No JS Website Project 🌐
### In this project I decided to make a website without any JS, pure _CSS_ and _HTML_
I decided to make this as a project for my markup lenguages class as a css final project.

## The main page 📄
This page is the main landing page of the website, as a web which has no _javascript_ I've opted to add some css animations instead and created a book-looking display on the middle, I've also took a coffee color palette theme to suit the minimalistic web design.

## The login 👨‍💻
This page surprisingly is also no JS, with the use of css animations and keyframes I got this modern hover look to my submit button, I've also added an easter-egg to the website in case you login. Feel free to try it out

## The macbook 💻
This is the most mind-blowing feature of the webpage, a fully animated macbook. Starting this project I never thought I would be doing anything like this with css only but here it is.

## Last add-ons 📌
To add some interactiveness to the webpage I added a redirect html page in the middle of each redirection to give it also a more modern look, feel free to check the [website](https://cristian-no-js.netlify.app)  in the _about_ section if you want to see the final result and animations for yourself.
